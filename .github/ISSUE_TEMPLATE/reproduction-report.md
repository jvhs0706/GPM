## 1. Fork Information

**Link to your fork:**  
[Paste your forked repository URL here]

## 2. Environment Details (Optional)

Please describe your hardware and software environment, if applicable.

> _e.g., 64 GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04, etc._

## 3. Reproduction Outcome

Please check the box that applies and provide details as needed.

- [ ] ✅ I confirm that I successfully reproduced the reported results (within acceptable variation), and my findings are consistent with the paper’s conclusions.

**If you observed any differences or anomalies, please describe them below:**  
> _e.g., minor deviations in accuracy, runtime, or resource usage._

_(Note: Differences across hardware and environments are common. Please focus on qualitative trends and reproducibility within expected variation. In particular, runtime can be up to 10× slower under high system load, which at one point almost made me worry the paper was non-reproducible.)_

## 4. Additional Comments (Optional)

> _Any suggestions, insights, or notable implementation details you would like to share._
